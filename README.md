# allen-readme-generator

This week's assignment consisted of starter code given to us, in which we had to create a generator that enables a user to create a README file for his or her own project. This README includes sections of Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, etc. A badge is also generated at the top of this README indicating which license is being used for this README. 

Assignment was created from help of TAs and tutor Armando Osorio.
